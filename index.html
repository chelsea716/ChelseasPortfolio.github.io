            <h3>Project 1: Dragon! A Videogame Background.</h3>
            <p>Background
                For video game designers/developers.
                Mockup idea of a background/foreground for a video game.
                Test and animate an original design.
                
                
                Problem
                New idea or concept for a scene in a video game.
                
                
                Process
                Get a few references for inspiration. Sketch a few ideas on Procreate. Refine sketches. Add color and details. Animate the idea. I approached this with the type of art style in video games that I enjoy.
                
                
                Results
                I enjoyed how the design came out and learned a bunch along the way. 
                This could have turned out better if I used a software such as Maya so that I could have made the environment 3D which I was not sure of how to do at the time.

            <h3>Project 2: Helping Inform People</h3>
            <p>Background
                For news and sports channels.
                Design and animated lower thirds.
                To showcase information as it is needed on TV.
                
                
                Problem
                Introduce a matching design for different scenarios whereas needed.
                
                
                Process
                Take in what details I want to add to the design. For this one in particular, I used the logo for inspiration. I added in the team's colors. My goal was to make it simple but eye catching and different.
                
                
                Results
                I enjoy how the design came out. This could have turned out better if I added in a more complex animation for how the lower thirds swoops in.

            <h3>Project 3: Reviving a Small Business</h3>
            <p>Background
                For a company that needed a new logo.
                
                
                Problem
                A dying company that needed to keep up with modern times.
                
                
                Process
                Interview the owner for what he liked and envisioned for his company. Sketch out a few designs and get feedback. Finalize the one the client liked.
                
                
                Results
                I had a bunch of ideas which showed in all of the sketches that I designed. It could have come out better if I added in the year the company was founded to show the years of experience.
